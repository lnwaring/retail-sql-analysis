# Retail Customer Analysis (SQL)

#### Summary

This project uses SQL to analyse a fictional dataset of customer transactions, product data, and loyalty activity from a retail business. The aim is to uncover commercial insights such as who the top customers are, which product categories perform best, and how loyalty tiers influence spending.

#### Tools & Skills Used:
- SQL (MySQL)
- Joins, aggregations, and window functions
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Business-focused insight generation

#### Questions Answered:
1. Who are the top 10 customers by total spend?
2. Which product categories drive the most revenue?
3. What’s the average transaction value by loyalty tier?
4. Which region has the highest number of transactions?
5. Which customers haven’t purchased in the last 30 days?
6. What is the total revenue by loyalty tier per month?
7. What is the ratio of one-time to repeat purchase customers?

#### How to View
- SQL queries can be found in `retail_analysis_queries.sql`
- Dataset includes four CSV files: `customers`, `products`, `transactions`, and `loyalty_activity`
